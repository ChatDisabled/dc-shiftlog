# dc-shiftlog

This was requested since [this one](https://github.com/Re2team/qb-shiftlog) "didn't work" properly.
I present you a shift log resource which doesn't handout your Discord webhooks for free ðŸ¥³. Testing and issues are appreciated.
But should work as intended.

You can always find support [here](https://discord.gg/SqRsSsSskg) in our Discord.
### Donations are **greatly** appreciated
